# 🃏 Solitaire Square
The goal of this project is to create a working version of solitaire.

## 🎯 About the Project
I like playing solitaire and I play it a lot while im waiting for stuff but the site I usually play it on has gotten quite predatory with their ads so I thought, "I'll make my own".

## ✨ Features
These are the features I want to implement:
- Drag and Drop: Simply drag cards to move them between stacks.
- Undo Move: Made a mistake? No worries, you can undo your last move.
- Hint: Stuck? Get a hint to see your next move.
- Restart Game: Start fresh anytime with a new deck.
- Responsive Design: Play on your desktop or phone!

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- React
- CSS
- DnD kit: A powerful set of utilities for drag-and-drop interactions.
